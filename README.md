# gmod-upload

This is an action to upload a Garry's Mod addon to the steam workshop.

## Examples

### Example 1
This call only provides the `id` and `changelog`, and expects there to be an `addon.json` in the root of the project that runs it.
_Taken from https://github.com/Vurv78/WebAudio/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml_

```yaml
name: Deploy to Workshop

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: CFC-Servers/gmod-upload@master
        with:
          id: 2466875474
          changelog: "Deployment via Github to latest changes"
        env:
          STEAM_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.STEAM_USERNAME }}
          STEAM_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.STEAM_PASSWORD }}
```

### Example 2
This call provides the `id` and `changelog`, but also defines a nonstandard path to find the `addon.json`.
In this case, there must be a file named `different.json` in the root of the project that calls this workflow.

```yaml
name: Deploy to Workshop

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: CFC-Servers/gmod-upload@master
        with:
          id: 2466875474
          changelog: "Deployment via Github to latest changes"
          config: "different.json"
        env:
          STEAM_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.STEAM_USERNAME }}
          STEAM_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.STEAM_PASSWORD }}
```

### Example 3
This call provides all of the information inline, eliminating the need for an `addon.json`
```yaml
name: Deploy to Workshop

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: CFC-Servers/gmod-upload@master
        with:
          id: 2466875474
          changelog: "Deployment via Github to latest changes"
          title: "[E2] WebAudio"
          type: "tool"
          tag1: "build"
          tag2: "fun"
          tag3: "realism"
        env:
          STEAM_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.STEAM_USERNAME }}
          STEAM_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.STEAM_PASSWORD }}
```
